/*
 * WHAT THIS EXAMPLE DOES
 *
 * We create a pool of 4 threads and then add 20 tasks to the pool.
 * Task simply print which thread is running them.
 *
 * As soon as we add the tasks to the pool, the threads will run them. It can happen that
 * you see a single thread running all the tasks (highly unlikely). It is up the OS to
 * decide which thread will run what. So it is not an error of the thread pool but rather
 * a decision of the OS.
